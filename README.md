**Realcraft** is a custom server implementation of
[Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) written in
[REALbasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REALbasic). It was started in 2013 by
Jailout2000 after an argument ensued on Innectis resulting in the rebellious
"I can code it better" being said to most of the Innectis community.

This project died as soon as it started. Jailout2000 was able to get as far as
spawning into a very flat, grassy world that the only actions anyone could take
was walk around a finite land and chat in the server's global chat. There was
no inventory, animals/NPCs or other entities, or even autogenerating "chunks"
should the player walk to the edge of the world.

This README was added years afterward to explain the remnants of this project.
If you wish to continue Realcraft, fork this repository and start making some
pull requests.

The last documented version of Minecraft that Realcraft could support was
Minecraft 1.3.2 ([source](http://wiki.vg/Server_List)). It most likely is not
compatible with the current versions of Minecraft.
